Basically trying to do a few things with "debugging".

Was thinking that debuggers are pretty cool, but often limited. They get used too late, when the bug is found and its critical, because they are not actually very useful for understanding your code. Being able to understand code is not just good for learning to program but also learning a new set of code. 

It feels like the general shape of debugging could also be used to produce a better experience for understanding the code. This is partially motivated by: [http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming). And also by less thought out things.

My goal is not really to build a replacement for a normal debugger or a code editor. Those are both complicated pieces of software that do their particular jobs. 

###caveats
Some stuff is broken from time to time. Putting in an issue is useful.
